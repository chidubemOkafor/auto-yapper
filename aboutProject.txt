Everlyn.ai is an AI startup that’s all about making video creation open and accessible to everyone. Their tagline is “your dreams as video,” which basically means you can turn words or photos into videos using AI 🚀. They’re pushing the idea of “agential video” — not just static clips, but videos where agents/characters can act, move, and feel alive, almost like little AI-powered actors.

They’re building something called Everworld, which they describe as the first virtual world of video agents. Think of it like an ecosystem of AI-driven characters and scenes, where anyone can create content fast, without expensive tools or Hollywood-level budgets.

The company positions itself as “open video for all”, suggesting they want to democratize access instead of keeping the tech locked up. They’re still in early stages — the site is focused on signups for a whitelist, and they’re backed by researchers and scientists with strong AI/video backgrounds.

In short: Everlyn is trying to flip video production from slow & expensive 🎥➡️ into something instant, creative, and open-source-driven ✨. Perfect for creators, dreamers, and anyone who wants to make AI-powered videos without being a pro editor.
